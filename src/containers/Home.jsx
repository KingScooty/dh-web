The one in the summer was so good, we\'re doing it again, for Halloween! \n As per Digital Heroes tradition; a fancy dress night out with all my closest friends &amp; wonderful Web/digital folk of Manchester. (*Fancy dress is a __must__ this time! :P*) - *[see previous years below for ideas.](#twitter-stream)* \n The plan is as follows: \n ## 18:00, SAT 31ST @ TBD, NQ \n Plan is hazy at the moment. Liverpool play Chelsea in the afternoon, so the festivities could potentially start as early as 12:45pm! All i know at the moment is we'll be off to Satan's Hollow in the evening. \n ## REALTIME DIARY OF THE EVENT \n Leave a tweet with the hashtag *#digitalheroes2015* or *#halloweenheroes2015* and your message (including images) will be pulled in below in realtime. Let's get a diary of the build up, and of the night itself! :-)`,
